# New York!
My Home üè†

I have been living in New York for the past 5 years and there is not other place I would call home.

## Setup and Run
1. Glitch Website: https://allmyheart.glitch.me/My%20%20Heart/
2. Glitch Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/allmyheart
3. Clone Github Repository: https://github.com/TammyJain1998/Web-Dev.git

Open the Folder "All my Heart" to access the html and css files.

## Concept and Steps
For this website, I developed a single page layout based on the same design concepts of 'Swiss Poster Design'.
I started by designing wireframes and then converted it to a high fidelity layout on figma. This also included coming up with a stylesheet with the fonts and color details.
I chose the color yellow, for my background to relate it to the yello taxis of NewYork.

## HTML and CSS Code
The project is made entirely using CSS and HTML code since we did not cover javaScript yet.
1. I added all the DOm elements using HTML and separated the main vreakdowns using the <div></div> finction.
2. All the styles have been added using CSS.

## Problems
1. I am still facing problems with the terminal, like deploying everything to github.
