# New York!
My Home üè†

I have been living in New York for the past 5 years and there is not other place I would call home.

## Setup and Run
1. Glitch Website: https://new-york-assignment2.glitch.me/New%20York/
2. Glitch Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/new-york-assignment2
3. Clone Github Repository: https://github.com/TammyJain1998/Web-Dev.git

Open the Folder "New York" to access the html and css files.

## Concept and Steps
For this website, I developed a single page layout based on the same design concepts of 'Swiss Poster Design'.
I started by designing wireframes and then converted it to a high fidelity layout on figma. This also included coming up with a stylesheet with the fonts and color details.
I chose the color yellow, for my background to relate it to the yello taxis of NewYork.

## HTML and CSS Code
The project is made entirely using CSS and HTML code since we did not cover javaScript yet.
1. I added all the DOm elements using HTML and separated the main vreakdowns using the <div></div> finction.
2. All the styles have been added using CSS.

## Weather API from OpenWeather
I enhanced my project by integrating real-time weather data through the OpenWeather API, starting by obtaining a complimentary API key. Initially, there was a waiting period of two hours for the activation of the key, during which I utilized the time effectively by diving into CodinTrain's informative videos on API usage. These tutorials were instrumental in familiarizing myself with JSON file handling. Once the key was activated, I began harvesting essential weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. To enrich the user experience and make the data more intuitive, I carefully selected and assigned relevant icons that accurately reflect the weather conditions described in the data. This step not only made the information more accessible but also visually engaging.

## Problems
1. I am still facing problems with the terminal, like deploying everything to github.
