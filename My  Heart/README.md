# My Heart!!My Dog!! üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂
Hello!!!

This website is designed and made for my pet, Macci. 

# Setup and Run
1. Glitch Website: https://allmyheart.glitch.me/My%20%20Heart/
2. Glitch Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/allmyheart
3. Clone Github Repository: https://github.com/TammyJain1998/Web-Dev.git

Open the Folder "All my Heart" to access the html and css files.

# Concept
Since this project was more about learning and experimenting with HTML and CSS, I decided to dedicate it to my pet. 

The project involed a simple mouse interaction where you need to hover over an image to see the smooth trensition in color. The image is my own artwork that I made for my pet sometime ago. The font used for this website is "Monaco". I tried to keep the font a little fun yet not the main focus of the page.

Additionally, the interaction instructions are alos mentioned on the page.

# HTML and CSS Code
The project is made entirely using CSS and HTML code. 
1. I used the CSS code to adjust the font of the text along with its allignemnt and color.
2. Additionally, the mouse interaction is also coded using CSS
3. The was the page is setup is all done in HTML which involves the 2 by 1 grid placement of the images, just so the users can also compare what the images look like next to each other.

# Problems
1. Terminal: When I am adding python to my terminal, nothing seems to be working. 
- I am a little lost while accessing through the comandline.
- I am also unable to get an SSH key and as of now I have been working with github desktop to push all the changes to the repo.
2. Glitch: Initially, I faced problems with glitch that involved adding my GitHub repo to glitch, but later it worked out. I followed the following process:
- Create an account on Glitch.com.
- Create a new project and copy link from my GitHub repository.
- Click on view full preview to access the full website.
