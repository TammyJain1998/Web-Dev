Hello!!!

This website is designed and made for my pet, Macci. 

# Setup and Run
1. Glitch Website: https://allmyheart.glitch.me/My%20%20Heart/
2. Glitch Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/allmyheart
3. Clone Github Repository: https://github.com/TammyJain1998/Web-Dev.git

Open the Folder "All my Heart" to access the html and css files.

# Concept
Since this project was more about learning and experimenting with HTML and CSS, I decided to dedicate it to my pet. 

The project involed a simple mouse interaction where you need to hover over an image to see the smooth trensition in color. The image is my own artwork that I made for my pet sometime ago. The font used for this website is "Monaco". I tried to keep the font a little fun yet not the main focus of the page.

Additionally, the interaction instructions are alos mentioned on the page.
